# Plan Indicator Scripts
This is a pilot repository that stores R and Python scripts which automatically pull, clean, and process plan indicator data from CMAP's ArcGIS Online platform to track and visualize the implementation of ON TO 2050.

The existing [repository](https://github.com/CMAP-REPOS/ONTO2050-indicators) is used to store the data (and associated documentation) for each indicator, which then feeds into the Javascript-based [dashboard](https://cmap-repos.github.io/ONTO2050-indicators/). However, given CMAP's transition to an ESRI-based [data hub](https://datahub.cmap.illinois.gov/), this pilot repo will store the scripts that will attempt to link plan indicator data stored on the data hub to an ESRI-based dashboard.
